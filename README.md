# Simple Database Application with LINQ Queries
This project is a simple database application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a dataset.
It serves as an implementation and practice project to reinforce the concepts and techniques learned in programming and working with databases.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on opportunity to implement and practice the following:
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: The application demonstrates the usage of LINQ queries to handle data retrieval, filtering, sorting, and updating. It showcases the power and flexibility of LINQ in working with collections and databases.
- **CRUD Operations**: The project focuses on the core database operations: creating (adding) new entries, reading (retrieving) existing entries, updating entries, and deleting entries. It provides a practical context to understand and apply these fundamental operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project leverages OOP principles by defining classes such as `Book` and `Database` to encapsulate data and functionality. It showcases the use of classes, properties, methods, and object interactions.

## Usage
To use the database application, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Build and run the application.
4. The application will demonstrate the usage of the database by performing sample CRUD operations on a dataset of books.
Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs. You can add more functionality, extend the database schema, or integrate it into a larger application.

## Dependencies

The project is written in C# and requires the .NET framework. It does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard libraries provided by .NET.
